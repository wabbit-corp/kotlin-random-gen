/**
 * [Tape] is an internal data structure for reading random bits in a deterministic,
 * replayable way. It allows us to reconstruct the entire chain of "random" decisions
 * for a particular generated value, as well as attempt "shrinks" by flipping bits
 * near the beginning of the tape.
 *
 * The design here is inspired by Hedgehog-style property-based testing:
 *   - We store bits in a [MutableBitDeque].
 *   - Each generated value reads some number of bits off the tape.
 *   - If a test fails, we can try toggling bits early in the tape to see if that
 *     produces a "smaller" failing input.
 *
 * Normally, you won't need to use [Tape] directlyâ€”just call higher-level functions
 * like [Gen.checkAll], [Gen.foreach], or [Gen.sample]. However, if you need custom
 * manipulations or want to debug the bit-level representation of generated values,
 * you can delve into [Tape], [TapeSeed], and the related classes.
 *
 * NOTE: This class may change in future versions. Rely on it only if you are prepared
 * for potential internal API adjustments.
